## 2. Project summary

### Device Description

Our device is an Internet-connected wearable badminton tutorial system that uses two IMU sensors to capture a player’s swing motion and provide feedback on technique. It is designed to help beginners practice independently by turning raw motion data into understandable coaching cues.

This project was inspired by the difficulty of learning badminton without a coach. Traditional video tutorials show correct movements, but they cannot tell the learner whether their own swing is correct. Our device addresses this gap by using motion sensing and machine learning to provide feedback-based learning with relatively simple hardware.

The Internet augments the device in two major ways. First, it allows sensor data, acceleration plots, and inference results to be transmitted to a Node-RED dashboard for visualization and review. Second, Internet connectivity makes future firmware or model updates possible, so the device can stay up to date as the feedback algorithm improves.

### Device Functionality

The device is designed as a combined hardware and software system for evaluating a badminton high-clear swing. On the hardware side, a Silicon Labs 917 MCU collects acceleration and angular velocity data from two IMU sensors through I2C. A user button starts the swing recording process after a three-second delay, giving the user time to prepare. An LCD provides quick instructions, and a vibration motor alerts the user when the swing is about to begin. The system is powered by a 3.7V lithium battery with supporting power-management circuitry.

On the software side, the MCU initializes the sensors, waits for the user to press the button, records swing data, and sends the data through the Internet-connected pipeline. The collected data is visualized on the Node-RED dashboard as acceleration graphs, allowing users to better understand their movement dynamics. The trained CNN model or cloud inference pipeline analyzes the swing quality, and the result is shown on the dashboard as feedback for the user. The overall learning loop is: learn from a video, record a swing, view the data and inference result, refine the technique, and repeat.

### Challenges

One major challenge was integrating IMU data transmission with the TCP-based communication pipeline. When we tried to place the IMU data flow directly into TCP communication, the firmware became unstable and sometimes froze. To overcome this, we changed the communication design and used MQTT through Node-RED, which provided a more reliable and flexible way to transmit sensor data and display results.

Another challenge was machine learning deployment. After converting and quantizing the trained model for embedded use, the model accuracy dropped and it was no longer able to reliably recognize the badminton swings. Instead of forcing an unstable embedded model to work, we adjusted the system design and moved inference to the cloud or external processing side. This allowed us to preserve the overall device functionality while still using machine learning for feedback.

In addition to the IMU communication and model deployment challenges, we also faced firmware integration issues with the LCD driver. The LCD library came from a previous semester project and used a different build method, so it did not work directly in our current firmware structure. We fixed this by modifying the driver code and adapting the syntax/build configuration until it worked with our project.

We also encountered frequent TIME OUT errors while flashing the device. We found a practical workaround by pressing Flash in VS Code, holding RESET for several seconds, releasing it, and then power cycling the board. This made the flashing process more reliable during development.

### Prototype Learnings

Building and testing this prototype taught us that a working end-to-end system is more important than pursuing the most advanced solution from the beginning. We originally hoped to run the complete machine learning pipeline on the device, but the hardware, firmware, and model-deployment constraints made this difficult. A more practical approach is to first make the sensing, communication, visualization, and feedback loop work reliably, then gradually optimize the model and move more computation onto the device.

If we built the device again, we would take a more incremental approach. We would first validate IMU data collection and dashboard visualization, then add feedback logic, then test simple classification, and only after that attempt full embedded model deployment. We would also design the communication pipeline earlier, because reliable data transfer is essential for debugging both hardware and machine learning behavior.

### Next Steps & Takeaways

The next step is to improve model deployment and make inference more stable. This includes researching better TinyML conversion methods, improving quantization-aware training, reducing model size, and testing whether a simplified model can run reliably on the MCU. Another important step is to improve the feedback design so that the system does not only classify the swing, but also gives more specific coaching suggestions. The hardware can also be improved through a more compact PCB, better wearable packaging, and more robust battery integration.

We also need to collect more meaningful swing data to reduce model overfitting and improve classification reliability. Another improvement would be building a protective case so the device is safer and more comfortable to wear during repeated badminton practice.

## 3. Hardware & Software Requirements

Summary of Gaps: The two main gaps were that the IMU sampling rate reached 200 Hz instead of the original 1000 Hz target, and the CNN model was not successfully deployed on the MCU after conversion and quantization.
